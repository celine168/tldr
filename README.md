## Goals
This website is essentially a note-taker/note-annotator. This website can help all students, but is geared specifically for aiding individuals with disablities such as ADHD and autism. Ideally, we would have liked to be able to set up a feature for speech-to-text where individuals can use the website to find key phrases from lecture, for instance. This would aid individuals with ADHD since their attention span may not last the entire class time and can give them a reference of where to start. We would also like to add a feature that measures sentiment, which would help individuals with autism in being able to tell the tone of the sentence. 

## Features
User enters text that they want to get key phrases from. Once input is entered, there will be a list of key words on the left side of the screen, which is sorted by categories, then sorted in descending order of relevance, that individuals can click to  
highlight key phrases.

## Dependencies
Make sure to have the latest node.js installed to start up the local web server. 

## Build
To build this project, clone a repository into your local drive. Then, start up the web server by typing in `node server.js`. Once done, it should run under `http://localhost/8080`.
